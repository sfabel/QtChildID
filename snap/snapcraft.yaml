  description: |
    This is an old version of the QT-based Child ID system used by the Grand Lodge of Hawaii
    to conduct Child ID events. It allows you to register a child, take fingerprints and
    print IDs. At no point is any data stored either locally or remotely, so this is completely secure.

  grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
