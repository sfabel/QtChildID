  summary: QT4-based Child ID System
  description: |
    This is an old version of the QT4-based Child ID system used 
    by the Grand Lodge of Hawaii to conduct Child ID events. It 
    allows you to register a child, take fingerprints and print IDs. 
    At no point is any data stored either locally or remotely, so 
    this is completely secure.
